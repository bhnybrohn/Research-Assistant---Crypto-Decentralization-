# Research-Assistant---Crypto-Decentralization-
Decentralization is an important part of the future. You shouldn't need to be convinced but you can read (https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e).    It's important that as a local crypto community, we build skillsets and expertise across multiple domains: Deep Math, Cryptography, Crypto protocol development, smart contracts, crypto applications, UX improvements, Game theory and Finance   The goal is to find exceptionally brilliant individuals who are excited to learn about the intersection of these fields and who can apply these skills to generate deep insights, thesis and opportunities about the global and local crypto space.

1. Finance: 
    - Write a 500-word explanation of Bitcoin stock-to-flow model and make an argument for why it is a bad model?
    - (Please show your workings). Yara Inc is listed on the NYSE with a stock price of $40 - the company is not known to pay dividends. We need to price a call option with a strike of $45 maturing in 4 months. The continuously-compounded risk-free rate is 3%/year, the mean return on the
    stock is 7%/year, and the standard deviation of the stock return is 40%/year. What is the Black-Scholes call price?
2. Computer Science
    - Why is it a bad idea to use recursion method to find the fibonacci of a number?
    - Write a function that takes in a Proth Number and uses Proth's theorem to determine if said number is prime? You can write this in any programming language but C/C++/Golang are preferred
3. Maths 
    - (Please show your workings). Over all real numbers, find the minimum value of a positive real number, y such that

        $y = sqrt((x+6)^2 + 25) + sqrt((x-6)^2 + 121)$
